1) Check if the GRUB boot-loader is shown before the initialization of the Linux OS
2) If you don't see the GRUB, you need to follow these steps:
    1) From the /home or /root directory:
        sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    2) Put a '#' in front of the "GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0"
    3) Make GRUB have some delay and change the GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 to any seconds you want (5 is okey)
    4) sudo update-grub && reboot
3) While waiting in GRUB press 'e'
4) Scroll down and search for "linux" on the left side and /boot/vlminuz... on the right 
5) Change the "ro quiet splash $vt_handoff" with rw init=/bin/bash
6) Ctrx + X or F10 for saving and exit, then ENTER to boot
7) Now you should have a terminal like: root@(node)
8) Mount the system: 
    mount | grep -w /
9) passwd (username) to change password of local user 

Have fun reset ethically your password!
