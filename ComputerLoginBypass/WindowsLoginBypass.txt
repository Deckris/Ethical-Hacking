DISCLAIMER: This is ONLY for educational purposes. Do not bypass a windows PC that you have no legal right or permission to bypass. 
            Instead, use this guide to reset you Windows Account Password if you forgot it, or help a friend who has this issue! Be kind :)

software used: Linux Live OS 
               chntpw (to edit the SAM files)

Instructions: 
1)  Make a Live CD/Live Usb Linux OS (Ubuntu and Mint tested and working)
2)  Connect to the internet and open a terminal
3)  Install chntpw using:
      sudo add-apt-repository universe
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install chntpw
4)  Find the windows partition with the command:
      sudo sfdisk -l
5)  Make a directory to mount Windows there:
      mkdir ~/winmount
6)  Mount Windows:
      sudo mount /dev/sda2 ~/winmount (/dev/sda2 is the windows partition, in your case it could have another name)
7)  Navigate to System32/config directory:
      cd ~/winmount/Windows/System32/config/
8)  Start the chntpw tool there to edit the SAM database (Security Account Manager):
      sudo chntpw -i SAM
9)  Press 1 to edit the users passwords
10) Put the RID and then press 1 to clear the password 

Editing the password was not working for me 

Hope this guide helps and do not need to format your Windows Machine if you got locked away!
